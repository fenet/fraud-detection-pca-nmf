Project Overview

This project demonstrates dimensionality reduction techniques using:

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)

The goal is to reduce feature space while preserving important structure and interpretability.

Objectives

- Understand high-dimensional data representation
- Apply PCA for variance-based dimensionality reduction
- Apply NMF for parts-based representation
- Compare reconstruction quality and interpretability

Techniques Used

- PCA (Eigen decomposition / SVD)
- NMF (Matrix factorization with non-negativity constraints)

Dataset

- Olivetti Dataset

Tech Stack
 
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
